=head1 NAME

Template::Plugin::JSON - Adds a .json vmethod for all TT values.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	[% USE JSON ( pretty => 1 ) %];

	<script type="text/javascript">

		var foo = [% foo.json %];

	</script>

	or read in JSON

	[% USE JSON %]
	[% data = JSON.json_decode(json) %]
	[% data.thing %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin provides a C<.json> vmethod to all value types when loaded. You
can also decode a json string back to a data structure.

It will load the L<JSON> module (you probably want L<JSON::XS> installed for
automatic speed ups).

Any options on the USE line are passed through to the JSON object, much like L<JSON/to_json>.
